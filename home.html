        <h3>Scenario</h3>
        <p>
            Your new product launch has generated tremendous market excitement, and you have been flooded with incoming requests from customers.
            Many of them are existing customers who want to try out your new product!
        </p>
        <h3>Your Task</h3>
        <p>
            To handle this massive inflow of customer interest, you must correctly identify each customer. 
            Luckily, you have some AI tools at your disposal. Using Human + AI collaboration, 
            you can apply human judgement in real-time to the suggestions of a fuzzy logic ML module.
        </p>
        <p>
            You must then capture these updates as they happen, and use it in real-time to drive sales opportunities. 
            You will handle data quality issues along the way, and produce dashboards to drive business decisions.
        </p>
        <h3>Next Step</h3>
        <p>
            Select the best match for <b>10 customers</b>, choosing from the options presented by the fuzzy logic matching engine.
            Try to do this as quickly as possible, so that we don't miss potential sales. Good luck!
